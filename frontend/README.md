# TODO

## Fixes

<!-- Fix gifs flashing -->
<!-- Fix customization not initializing on Island -->

Try to gather explore & customize panels (open 1 close 2)
Hide icon: on hover, set panels opacity to low

Fix tracks not playing on mobile (need to pause + play again)
++ a few pixels too large on the right
++ loading screen stays up on safari

## Implementations

Page for collectors with ens/address after /
Replace blockchain with database? planetscala + SIWE
Customize personal page + show a track en avant
Add referal links when it can be done
Create playlist
Share customized playlist as one-page
Create home page with explanations, guide, etc + beta caption
Find a way to scale (already hitting Alchemy throughput limit with 1 user)
Form to fill for allowlist

### Swarm

Increment radius smoothly on bass hits
And/or use scale for bass & brightness for high freqs
-> need to separate freqs more comprehensively (see THREE audio analyser)
--> see https://codesandbox.io/s/sinestezia-zg9xcf?file=/src/Canvas/Analyzer.js

### Later

Maybe use a ERC20 token for gasless? can easily deduct from transactions
deposit function to add credits
Use 'pay as you go' (just sign tx and pay, no need for whitelist) or whitelist (pay upfront and sign with our private key)
SUSTAINABILITY: too much tracks to load all if it gets more popular
