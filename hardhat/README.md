addShortenerURL -> Make sure it's related to the domain
Allow only favorites & urls from the website maybe, after checking allowlist status (so no abuse)
removeFavorite -> more efficient

Or maybe just mapping address => trackId => bool for more gas efficient
and track with TheGraph favorites
so way more gas efficient but needs to pay for TheGraph.
